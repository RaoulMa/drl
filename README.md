### About
Implementation of DDPG, PPO, DQN and VPG agents to solve various OpenAI gym environments 
using Tensorflow and PyTorch. The focus is on simple and short code.  

This repository serves the purpose of self-teaching. The implementations are not particularly
clear, efficient, well tested or numerically stable. We advise against using this software for non-didactic
purposes.
